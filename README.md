## **DIGITAL CONTROL OF BOAT DIRECTION**

---

## Overview
This project develops a **digital control system for the orientation of a cargo vessel**, based on the **Nomoto second-order dynamic model**.  
The control architecture uses both **Pole-Placement** and **Truxal (Ragazzini–Guillemin)** methods to achieve **accurate heading tracking** and **robust disturbance rejection** under wind and hydrodynamic perturbations.

The implementation and simulation were carried out in **Scilab/Xcos**, focusing on system stability, discrete-time performance, and steady-state accuracy.

## System Description
The vessel is modeled as a nonlinear system simplified to a second-order transfer function according to Nomoto’s hydrodynamic model:

> Inputs: Rudder angle δ(s)  
> Outputs: Ship heading ψ(s)  
> Perturbations: Hydrodynamic resistance and wind torque  

Physical constraints such as rudder limits (±35°) and actuator saturation are included.  
The discrete equivalent system is obtained using a **1 s sampling period**, ensuring proper time resolution for digital control.

## Controller Design
Two digital controllers were designed and compared:

1. **Pole-Placement Controller**  
   - Zero steady-state error (ep = 0)  
   - Settling time Ts ≤ 200 s  
   - Overshoot Mp ≤ 5 %  
   - Discrete design via Diophantine equation and Sylvester matrix formulation  

2. **Truxal (Ragazzini–Guillemin) Controller**  
   - Equivalent closed-loop performance  
   - Simplified digital synthesis ensuring internal stability  
   - Implemented for both **reference tracking** and **disturbance rejection** in a two-degree-of-freedom structure  

---

## Simulation and Results
- Identical responses were achieved using both design methods, confirming theoretical equivalence.  
- The system exhibits **zero steady-state error** and **smooth transient response** with negligible overshoot.  
- Under external perturbations (wind and rudder torque), the controller successfully maintains orientation with less than ±5° deviation.  
- The digital and analog implementations match closely under the Tustin discretization method.
